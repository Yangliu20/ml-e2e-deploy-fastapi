# Deployment of BERT and ViT models for real-time prediction as REST API

This project builds an end-to-end ML pipeline to serve 3 **finetuned models** (BERT and ViT) as a REST API on **AWS EC2** using **Python** and **FastAPI**, achieving sentiment analysis, disaster tweet classification, and human pose classification. It is containerized with **Docker** and leverages **Nginx** for load balancing. An interactive **Streamlit** web application is also developed to serve the model by API requests through a user-friendly interface.
